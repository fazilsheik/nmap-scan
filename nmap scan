# Network Scanning & Analysis Project

This project demonstrates basic **network reconnaissance** using **Nmap** for port scanning and **Wireshark** for traffic analysis.

# Objectives
- Scan a local network to identify live hosts and open ports.
- Analyze common services (HTTP, SSH, DNS, etc.).
- Understand risks associated with open ports.
- Use Wireshark to verify scan packets and observe network behavior.

# Tools Used
- **Nmap** – For scanning IPs and discovering open ports.
- **Wireshark** – For capturing and analyzing packet-level data.

# Features
- TCP SYN and UDP scans with Nmap.
- Detection of filtered, open, and closed ports.
- Wireshark trace analysis of port scanning activities.
- Security risk interpretation for open ports.
